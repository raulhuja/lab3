        <h2>The Wolf of Wall Street</h2>
        <p> This movie is a true story about Jordan Belfort and his life. He started out as a broker on wallstreet and then he got let go because the market had crashed. So then, he tried to sell penny stocks and got 50% commission off of it. He later decided to start his own company and start taking money from richer people. He had millions upon millions of dollars. But the question is, was this all legal. Absolutely not! In the end he did quite a few years in jail.</p>
        <p>I really enjoy this movie because they are so many events within the movie that we can learn from as viewers. Learn from the rights and wrongs and know that this stuff is actually happening in the world. Leonardo Dicaprio did an amazing job with his role and that made the movie more enjoyable to watch.</p>
        <p>The movie is rated R and is more leaned towards older teens and adults who love Leonardo Dicaprio or love watch movies based on finance.</p>
